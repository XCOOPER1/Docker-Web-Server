# Docker-Web-Server
Welcome to my DevOps Docker Web Server project! This project demonstrates my expertise in setting up, managing, and automating a web server infrastructure using Docker. Iâ€™ve built a production-ready environment that leverages modern technologies such as containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and service orchestration. Here's an overview of what this project entails:

**Key Features**:
- A fully containerized web server using **Docker**.
- A **WordPress** site hosted within a Docker container for content management.
- **phpMyAdmin** for easy database management using **MySQL**.
- Reverse proxying with **Nginx** for improved security and traffic handling.
- Automated deployments with **GitHub Actions** to streamline development and operations.

This project is an excellent example of my ability to use DevOps practices and tools to automate infrastructure deployment and maintenance.
